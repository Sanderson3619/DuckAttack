/* My attempt at static and dynamic binding. This class would create instances
 * of normal and gold ufos, using static and dynamic binding. Then, we could call
 * those classes and call thsoe functions. However, gameobjects only execute code if
 * the functions are attached to the object itself. Since these functions are being executed from a
 * created class, the gameobject does not move as intended. So, instead of creating instances of classes
 * like this, we assign prefabs the classes of UFOEnemy and GoldUFOEnemy and Instantiate the prefabs.
